## Introduction

Every time we conduct an analysis, we need to formulate hypotheses that need to be further tested. Sometimes, the tests we perform lead us to accept these hypotheses, while other times we need to reject them. To make informed decisions in business, we need to understand whether the assumptions we make are correct or not.

In this project, you will compare the music preferences of users in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You will study actual Y.Music data to test the following hypotheses and compare user behavior in these two cities.

## Objectives

Test three hypotheses:

- User activities vary depending on the day and city.
- On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This also applies to Friday nights.
- Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

## Data:

- 'userID' — user ID
- 'Track' — track title
- 'artist' — artist name
- 'genre'
- 'City' — city where the user is located
- 'time' — duration of the song played
- 'Day' — day of the week

## Libraries:

- pandas
