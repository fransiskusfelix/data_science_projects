# Data Science Project

Welcome to my data science project repository! This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for my data science projects. In this project, I explore various aspects of data science, including data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to solve a specific problem or address a particular question using data science techniques. I follow a structured and iterative process to extract insights from data, build predictive models, and communicate my findings effectively.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the raw and processed datasets used in the project. It may also include any additional data sources or files required for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase the data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and visualization steps. Each notebook is labeled with a descriptive name that reflects its purpose.
- `scripts/`: This directory contains any additional scripts or code files used in the project, such as utility functions, data preprocessing scripts, or model evaluation scripts.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained models generated during the project. It may also include any serialized objects or files related to the models.
- `reports/`: This directory contains project reports, summaries, and any visualizations generated from the data analysis. It may include both intermediate and final reports.
- `docs/`: This directory contains project documentation, including the project scope, methodology, and any relevant references or resources.
