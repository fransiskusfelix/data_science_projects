# Data Science Project

Welcome to my data science project repository! This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for my data science projects. In this project, I explore various aspects of data science, including data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to solve a specific problem or address a particular question using data science techniques. I follow a structured and iterative process to extract insights from data, build predictive models, and communicate my findings effectively.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `project_x/`: This directory contains every project I completed.
- `datasets/`: This directory contains the raw and processed datasets used in the project. It may also include any additional data sources or files required for analysis.
