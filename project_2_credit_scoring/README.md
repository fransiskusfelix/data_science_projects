## Introduction

The task is to prepare a report for the credit division of a bank. I will investigate the influence of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of defaulting on loan repayment. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of its customers.

The report will be considered when making credit assessments for prospective customers. Credit assessments are used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.

## Objectives

Testing these hypotheses:    

- The number of children a customer has significantly affects the probability of defaulting on loan repayment.
- Marital status significantly influences the probability of defaulting on loan repayment.
- Income level significantly affects the probability of defaulting on loan repayment.
- The purpose of the loan significantly influences the probability of defaulting on loan repayment. 

## Data:

- children - number of children in the family
- days_employed - customer's work experience in days
- dob_years - customer's age in years
- education - customer's education level
- education_id - identifier for the customer's education level
- family_status - identifier for the customer's marital status
