    "1. There are some missing values in certain columns, where 'days_employed' and 'total_income' have missing values. To fill in the missing values, the median of the respective columns is used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. There are some duplicate data, amounting to 71 data points. The duplicate data is removed to prevent unwanted influence on the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hypothesis Testing 1: There is no correlation between having children and the probability of loan default. The more children an individual has, the lower the probability of loan default.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hypothesis Testing 2: There is a correlation between family/marital status and the probability of loan default. Married individuals have a higher likelihood of loan default compared to unmarried or divorced individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hypothesis Testing 3: There is a correlation between income level and the probability of loan default, ranging from Low to Very High, but not for Medium and Very Low. There is a possibility that the Very Low income category has too few data and could potentially be merged with the Low income category.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Hypothesis Testing 4: There is a correlation between loan purpose and the probability of loan default. Individuals who take larger loans (for property purchase) have a higher probability of default compared to those who take smaller loans (for other purposes such as car, education, or wedding).\n",
