## Introduction

The task is to prepare a report for the credit division of a bank. I will investigate the influence of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of defaulting on loan repayment. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of its customers.

The report will be considered when making credit assessments for prospective customers. Credit assessments are used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.

## Objectives

Testing several hypotheses:

- Hypothesis 1: The newer the vehicle model, the higher its price.
- Hypothesis 2: Vehicles with lower odometer readings will have higher prices compared to vehicles with higher odometer readings.
- Hypothesis 3: Vehicles in good condition will have higher prices compared to vehicles in poor condition.
- Hypothesis 4: Vehicles with better transmission types (e.g., automatic) will have higher prices compared to vehicles with less favorable transmission types (e.g., manual).
- Hypothesis 5: Vehicles with more common paint colors (e.g., black or white) will have lower prices compared to vehicles with more exclusive paint colors (e.g., red or blue).
