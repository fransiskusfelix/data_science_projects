## Introduction

The task is to to study the dataset from the past few years and determine the factors that affect the price of a vehicle.

## Objectives

Testing several hypotheses:

- Hypothesis 1: The newer the vehicle model, the higher its price.
- Hypothesis 2: Vehicles with lower odometer readings will have higher prices compared to vehicles with higher odometer readings.
- Hypothesis 3: Vehicles in good condition will have higher prices compared to vehicles in poor condition.
- Hypothesis 4: Vehicles with better transmission types (e.g., automatic) will have higher prices compared to vehicles with less favorable transmission types (e.g., manual).
- Hypothesis 5: Vehicles with more common paint colors (e.g., black or white) will have lower prices compared to vehicles with more exclusive paint colors (e.g., red or blue). 

## Data:

Dataset contains the following columns:

- price
- model_year
- model
- condition
- cylinders
- fuel — gas, diesel, and others
- odometer — mileage of the vehicle at the time of the ad
- transmission
- paint_color
- is_4wd — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)
- date_posted — date the ad was posted
- days_listed — number of days the ad was listed before being removed

## Libraries:

- pandas
- matpotlib
